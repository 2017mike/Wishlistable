# Wishlistable
Wishlistable is an app created to create wish lists. I noticed that many people have Amazon wishlists which are great, but they can only use list Amazon products on those wishlists. With this app, people can create a shareable wish list with links to anywhere on the internet. 

Wishlistable was made using a SQL database called JawsDB hosted on Heroku. It uses the Materialize CSS library for front end and Node.js for backend. Npm packages include dotenv, express, jsonwebtoken, mysql2, passport, and sequelize.
